											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Welcome to my online portfolio! My name is Josh and I am an aspiring software engineer. I'm currently in
											my second year at the University of Toronto, majoring in Engineering Science. I am an active individual in the 
											programming community, often taking upon challenges like hackathons. In addition, I spend a lot of time working on 
											my own projects as well. I am also involved with school design teams such as the University of Toronto's Aerospace 
											Team. I have a strong passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning and I hope to pursue it in graduate 
											level studies. </p>

									<h2>My Projects</h2>

									<p>I find the funnest projects will always be in making games. Using python and the pygame module, I have 
										been able to develop these three interactive games. Not only that, but they are great for learning how 
										to program. Especially in strategy-type games, it will require thinking of algorithms for computers as
										well as the overall game logic. It is also very easy how your code is running because many things are 
										displayed for you. To view all of my projects, be sure to check out my github link at the bottom of the 
										page.</p>

								<h3>C</h3>
								<div class="content">
									<p>The great advantage in programming with C is getting a thorough understanding of pointers, memory management, 
										and data structures.</p>
									<strong>Cholesky Decomposition</strong>
									<p>Cholesky Decomposition is a recusive algorithm used to factor a square matrix. Without going into the details of the
										math behind it, this is a powerful tool capable of finding the inverse and determinants of large square matrices. This 
										project enhanced not only my algorithm background, but required a solid background of pointers and pointer arithmetic.</p>
									<strong>Router Queue Simulator</strong>
									<p>Queues are useful data structures that can simulate real world events following "First in First Out" policy. 
										This project implements the queue data structure in simulating how routers work. A router is capable of servicing 
										one data packet at a time. However, there are times when packets are arriving at a rate faster than the router can 
										serve. This is when the packets are stored within a queue. The most important output of this simulation is the average 
										wait time for a packet given parameters such as arrival rates and service rates.</p>
									<strong>Flow Networks</strong>
									<p>For example, treat a flow network as a system of pipes, where at some points, the pipes will converge and at others, the pipes
										will diverge. Also, each pipe has its own physical limitations, such as the maximum amount of flow that can go through it. 
										What we want to know about this network is the path that will result in the maximum flow. In this project, I have utilized the 
										graph data structure to represent the system and implemented the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to compute the maximum flow path. </p>
								</div>

								<h3>Verilog</h3>
								<div class="content">
									<p>Other than programming languages, I also have experience with Verilog, which is a hardware description language used to model 
										electronic systems. Using Altera DE1-SoC board and the Quartus Prime software, I have developed projects utilizing registers, counters, finite-state machines, etc. My favourite is simulating morse code using a finite-state-machine. The user enters a letter using the slide switches. After a key is pressed, the LED on the board will blink quickly for a dot and longer for a dash output.

								<p>In the summer of 2016, I had the opportunity to assist in research at the National University of Singapore. A fellow student 
									and I worked under Dr. Anjam Kursheed, who is a professor in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Under our 
									research project title, "Recreating Great Discoveries in Physics and Engineering", we were responsible to designing and manufacturing famous inventions of the past. The three main projects completed were an ancient greek water pump, an induction 
									coil, and a sterling engine demo. The kind of work that we did was really less research, and more engineering based. The overall goal of this research project was to design educational experiments for students to learn scientific concepts from. As well, it has helped Dr. Kursheed in writing a textbook used for educators. Because this was meant for experimental purposed, we had to keep our designs as simple as possible, while still showing the concepts and science behind it. In addition, all of our materials used were commerical level and easily accessible at most hardware stores, making it more feasible for large classes to perform. Below, I have also linked a more detailed report in pdf format.</p>
